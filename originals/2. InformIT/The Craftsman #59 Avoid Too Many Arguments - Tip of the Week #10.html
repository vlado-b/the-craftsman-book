<p><i>August
12, 1945, 10:30 AM Philadelphia</i></p>

<p><i>General
Groves walked up to the secretary at precisely 10:30 AM. This meeting was too critical to be
compromised by an error in punctuality. “Hello General.” Said Miss Ives. “Mr. Rearden is expecting you. Please go right in.”</i></p>

<p><i>Hank
Readen stood up and extended his hand as the General
walked into his office. “It is
good to see you again, General. How can I help you this time?”</i></p>

<p class=BODY3 style='text-indent:0in'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Rearden</i><i> gestured to
the chair next to his desk, and Groves took the seat.</i></p>

<p><i>“Hank,
we need steel. Lots of steel.”</i></p>

<p class=BODY3 style='text-indent:0in'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Rearden</i><i> chuckled. “General, that
is a problem I’d be very happy to help you with. How much steel are we talking about, and when do you need it?”</i></p>

<p><i>The
General’s eyes fixed upon Rearden’s with an intensity
that caused the smile to drain from Rearden’s face.</i></p>

<p><i>“Hank,
if you tripled your annual production, we’d take it all starting now.”</i></p>

<p class=BODY3 style='text-indent:0in'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Rearden</i><i> sat back and
let out his breath. </i></p>

<p><i>“Les,
that’s…”</i></p>

<p><i>“Look,
Hank, we need this. We’ll pay you
well for it, and loan you the capital to build new physical plant. But this has to be done fast, and it
can’t go wrong. Frankly, that’s
why we picked you for this. We
knew that if anyone could make the steel we need, it’d be Henry Rearden.”</i></p>



<p><i>The smile slowly returned to Rearden’s
face. “General, I’ll be happy to
work with you on this. I have some
inkling of what’s at stake. But
tell me, Les, are you sure it’s steel that you need?”</i></p>

<hr>

<p><i>Wed, 15 Mar 2002, 11:00</i></p>

<p>“No way, Avery, he’s just not that good.”</p>

<p>“Alphonse, he’ll beat the pants off him!”</p>

<p>We were sitting together at my workstation, discussion the
latest chess championship. </p>

<p>“Look, Avery, Eddie is going to pound Robie
into the back ranks. Did you see
how he slaughtered Wheeler?”</p>

<p>“Hell, Alphonse, It doesn’t take much to psych Wheeler, he
always gives up too many knights.”</p>

<p>Jasmine stuck her head up and glared at us. “Will you two hotshots keep a lid on it
please, people are trying to work over here.”</p>

<p>“Leave the boys alone.” Jerry interjected. “I’m interested to hear their view. I think Robie’s
going to fall like a rotten tree.”</p>

<p>Jasmine shifted her glare to Jerry. “Can it JJ! I need a little <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>peace</i> to fix this <i>mess</i>

you made last year.” </p>

<p>I looked at Avery and snickered. We both silently mouthed: “Jay-Jay?”</p>

<p>Jerry was taken aback. “Woah…huh? What mess? I
didn’t….”</p>

<p>But Jasmine wouldn’t be stopped. “This mess of an IO control function you wrote last
year. Cripes, JJ, how many
arguments can you cram into one function?”</p>

<p>Jerry got indignant. “Jasmine, that system works great! I didn’t make a mess!”</p>

<p>Jasper, Jared, and Adelaide popped their heads up to listen
in. This had the makings of a
pretty good show.</p>

<p>“OH YES YOU DID!” Jasmine looked around at the silent observers. “You should see this fracking
thing!”</p>

<p>Avery got a nasty grin on his face and started typing some
commands I hadn’t seen before.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” I whispered.</p>

<p>“Watch.” He replied.</p>

<p>And suddenly our screen filled with the contents of Jasmine’s
screen.</p>

<p>“How did you…” But Avery put his finger over his lips.</p>

<p>“You mean the IOTransfer
function?” Jerry wheedled. “But
that’s just a low level…”</p>

<p>“THAT’S THE ONE!” Jasmine declared with
triumph. “Crimeny,
Jeez! What a horror scene! Whoooeee!”</p>

<p>Avery carefully scrolled Jasmine’s screen until
he found this:</p>



<pre>int result = IOX(0x32, NO_PARITY|DMA1|CLUMP,
buf, 32, 500, true);</pre>



<p>Jerry looked around nervously. He could see that this was drawing an
audience. “But Jasmine, it’s just
a low level IO function.”</p>

<p>“JJ, dear…” (That got Jean’s attention.) “…it’s a low level IO function that
you call <i>all over the place</i>! I’m having the frackingest
time figuring out what each of those calls do! What possessed you?”</p>

<p>Avery opened an IM window and started sending
the viewport address of Jasmine’s screen to the observers. I could see them looking at their
screens and smiling.</p>

<p>“Aw, come on Jasmine, we were in a hurry! We had to…”</p>

<p>Avery started scrolling Jasmine’s screen. If she noticed we’d be toast. But she was right, calls to IOX were
all over the place, and they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>were</i> a horror scene.</p>

<pre>if (IOX(0x38, PARITY|DMA2, s2, l, t+200, false)
== 3) {
. . .
r |= IOX(0x19, VOID, startSequence, 2, -1, null);
. . .
IOX(0x18, INVERTED|NO_DMA|CLUMP, header, 16,
500, true);</pre>



<p>I heard startled and strangled
moans coming from nearby workstations. Apparently Avery was giving everyone the same tour of this code that I
was seeing. So far neither Jasmine
nor Jerry seemed to notice.</p>

<p>Jasmine wasn’t giving any ground. “You were in a hurry? And, what? You left all this crap all over the place? “</p>

<p>“Well, I…”</p>

<p>I caught a movement from Jean out of the corner
of my eye. It looked like she was
about to say something. But then I
saw a look come over her face that I’d never seen before. She raised an eyebrow, and then simply
sat back down. </p>

<p>Jasmine folded her arms and continued to press
her attack. “Can you please
explain the arguments of this function to me, JJ? …Can you?”</p>

<p>“OK, sure.” Jerry started to move over to Jasmine’s workstation.</p>

<p>“No you stay right there, JJ! I want you to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>tell</i> me from memory. What’s that first argument JJ?”</p>

<p>“OK, er, it’s the IO
address, I think.”</p>

<p>“I think your right, JJ, very good. But do you think you could have put
those blinking addresses in some nicely named variables? I mean, 0x38 doesn’t mean one hell of a
lot to me. What does it mean to
you?”</p>

<p>Jerry squirmed. “Uh, yeah, uh, I think
thirty-eight was the pressure transducer input.”</p>

<p>“I think you might just be right about that
JJ. I think it <i>is</i> the
pressure transducer input. It only
took me an hour to discover that by looking over the circuit diagrams of the
module. But never mind that, can
you please tell me what the PARITY and DMA and CLUMPING stuff is in the second
argument?”</p>

<p>Little beads of perspiration were trickling
down Jerry’s forehead. “Uh, well,
yeah. I think the second argument
was a set of bits that controlled the details of the transfer. They selected things like the DMA port,
and parity checking, and whether or not the data was sent byte-by-byte or in 8
byte clumps.”</p>

<p>“And how, dear JJ, would I figure this
out? It seems the only supporting
document I’ve got is the module circuit diagram, and a chain of ECO
modifications to it.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, well, we were just in such a hurry, you
know. We… Anyway, you can always ask me what
these things are…” Jerry shrugged, his face was pleading for Jasmine to let him off
the hook.</p>

<p>“Yes, you were in a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>hurry</i>. It shows! And now <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>I’m</i> stuck with the consequences of your rushing. Thanks. But please go on. What are the rest of the arguments of
this function?”</p>

<p>Jasmine looked at her screen. I saw her pause for half a second, and
then smirk to herself.</p>

<p>“Why don’t I just come over there and…”</p>

<p>Jasmine put her hands on her hips and said: “OH
NO, YOU JUST TELL ME.”</p>

<p>Jerry sighed. “OK, uh, there’s the buffer
address. The next is the length.”</p>

<p>“Stop right there. Is that length in <i>bytes</i>
JJ?”</p>

<p>“Uh, well, sometimes. That is, er, yes, it’s in bytes,
unless the CLUMP bit is set, and then it’s in, uh, eight byte clumps.”</p>

<p>“Nice… Go on. What comes next?”</p>

<p>I heard a faint echo of her words coming from
nearby workstations. I glanced at
Avery, and he smiled that evil smile of his. He pointed to his screen. He had set up a connection counter. There were 52 people connected to the
viewport he had set up. I saw that
he had also connected his microphone to the viewport,
so all 52 people could hear this exchange. I knew this wasn’t going to end well for us. </p>

<p>“Uh…” Jerry stammered. “Uh… the next argument is… uh… the timeout in milliseconds!”</p>

<p>Jasmine sneered, her voice dripping with
sarcasm. “Really? The timeout in milliseconds? Tell me JJ <i>dear</i>,
how long is minus one milliseconds?”</p>

<p>Jerry hung his head. “Oh, yeah, uh, yeah. We, uh, used -1 to mean wait forever.”</p>

<p>“I see, JJ, thank you. Negative one means forever. Good. That’s perfectly clear. Thanks… Now…
can you tell me about that last argument please?”</p>

<p>“You mean the Boolean?”</p>

<p>“Yes, JJ, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Boolean</i>.”</p>

<p>“Uh…<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; I think you pass true if you want the transfer to
abort on error, and false if you want it to ignore errors and just finish the
transfer.”</p>

<p>Jasmine’s smile was pure, cold, evil. “And what, JJ <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>dearest</i>, does it mean when you pass <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>null</i> into that Boolean argument?”</p>

<p>Jerry drooped like a rag doll. “Uh… null?”</p>

<p>“Yes, JJ, <i>null</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh yeah, uh… You’d pass null into the Boolean if the previous transfer
aborted on error, and you wanted to continue the transfer from where it left
off.”</p>

<p>“So let me get this straight, JJ, this is a
Boolean with <i>three</i> states…right?</p>

<p>“Well…”</p>

<p>“A BOOLEAN WITH THREE STATES…RIGHT?”</p>

<p>Jerry wouldn’t look up. “Uh…”</p>

<p>Jasmine’s voice ran cold. “Say it Jerry!”</p>

<p>Jerry sighed and stared at the floor. “Yes, it’s a Boolean with… three
states.”</p>

<p>“Thank you JJ, that was very informative. You may sit down now.”</p>

<p>Then Jasmine looked around the room, looked at
her screen, and then looked around the room once again. “I see that Avery and Alphonse have
managed to get about 60 people to watch our little show.”</p>

<p>Avery quickly hunched his shoulders and stared
at his hands. I wanted to be
anywhere else except where I was.</p>

<p>“OK all you voyeurs, take this as a
lesson. Don’t make functions with
lots of arguments. They’re <i>hard</i> to understand. Create objects instead. Now <i>look
at your screens</i>!” </p>

<p>Jasmine had scrolled to one of the first calls
to IOX. </p>

<pre>int result = IOX(0x32, NO_PARITY|DMA1|CLUMP,
buf, 32, 500, true);</pre>



<p>“I want all you lurkers out there to consider
that Jerry <i>could</i> have written it like
this:</p>

<pre>IOChannel temperatureTransducer = new
