<p><em>Saturday,
September 1, 1945, 10:45AM GMT, Caen, France.</i></em></p>

<p><em>Corporal
Murphy and Leftenant Haynes crouched behind an overturned horse-cart that had
been filled with bricks. The bricks
made a reasonable bulwark against the potshots of the sniper in the second
floor of the storefront across the street.</i></em></p>

<p><em>“Can
you see him, Audie?” Haynes asked?</i></em></p>

<p><em>“Nah,
I recon I’ll have to wait for him to shoot at us again. I don’t suppose you’d care to wave your
rifle in the air to draw his fire?”</i></em></p>

<p><em>Haynes
just glared at his diminutive companion. He was glad that the Americans had sent so many troops to help England
fight back the remnants of the German occupation forces, and clean up the mess
in Europe, but this particular Texan reminded him a bit too much of the movies
about the American west he used to like to watch in the cinema.</i></em></p>

<p><em>The
Texan picked up a brick and handed it to Haynes. “When I tell you to, toss that brick over to the right about
30 feet.”</i></em></p>

<p><em>Haynes
took the brick and watched as Murphy took aim on the building. Then Murphy said: “Go!” and Haynes
tossed the brick. Murphy’s rifle
cracked a second after the brick hit the ground.</i></em></p>

<p><em>“That
fella got a little too curious. I
don’t recon he’ll be curious about anything else again. We’d best get movin’.”</i></em></p>



<p><i>Haynes nodded, and the two of them dashed across the street and into
the store. As he ran, Haynes
wondered how the battle for London was going.</i></p>

<p>“Hey Hotshot, got a minute?”</p>

<p>I was just coming back from a break and
happened to walk past Jasmine’s workstation. I happen to walk past Jasmine’s workstation a lot. </p>

<p>“What’s up, Jasmine?”</p>

<p>“Look at this code. What does this mean to you?”</p>

<p>She had highlighted one line on her screen.</p>



<pre> impactCount += scanImpacts(ImpactType.SMALL_PUNCTURE, impacts);</pre>



<p>“Oh, you must be working with the
micrometeoroid impact locator app. I’ve heard that’s a real mess.”</p>

<p>Jasmine smiled and sneered at the same time.</p>

<p>“Yeah, it was written about ten years ago, and
it’s pretty tough to work with.”</p>

<p>I looked more closely at the line of code she
had highlighted. </p>

<p>“OK, so it’s counting the number of small
punctures in the <tt>impacts</tt> list.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s what I thought too.”</p>

<p>“You mean that’s not what it does?”</p>

<p>Jasmine fixed me with those gimlet green eyes
and shook her head. Her long black
hair shimmered and danced. </p>

<p>“No, that’s not at all what it does.”</p>

<p>I snapped back to reality. “Uh… it’s not?”</p>

<p>Jasmine chuckled and said: “Dyson to Alphonse,
are you there? No Hotshot, that’s
not what this line of code does. &#8211; Hay Jerry, got a minute?”</p>

<p>I’d noticed that Jerry happened to walk past
Jasmine’s workstation a lot too.</p>

<p>“I swear, Jasmine, whatever it is, I didn’t do
it!”</p>

<p>I laughed under my breath. The dressing down she had given him
yesterday had been pretty funny.</p>

<p>“Relax, Jerry, I just want you to look at some
code.”</p>

<p>“Who wrote it? If it was me, forget it!”</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t you, Jerry, it was written ten
years ago by Jean.”</p>

<p>Jean stood up from her workstation. “Did someone mention my name?”</p>

<p>Jasmine smiled at her and said: “We’re just
looking at some code you wrote a long time ago, Jean.”</p>

<p>Jean’s grin and eyes got wide. “Oh my dears, I wish you lots of luck
with that. Call me if you need
me.” And she sat back down.</p>

<p>Jerry had been looking at the highlighted line
of code. </p>

<p>“This is part of that old micrometeoroid impact
locator isn’t it?” And then under his breath: “What a dog that system is. Anyway, it looks like this statement scans the <tt>impacts</tt> list for small punctures.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought too.” I blurted. “But Jasmine says no.”</p>

<p>Jerry looked confused. “I don’t see what else it could be
doing. It scans the <tt>impacts</tt> list for impacts that have been classified as <tt>ImpactType.SMALL_PUNCTURE.</tt> </p>

<p>Jasmine laughed and said: “I love it when you
talk to me in code, Jerry.”</p>

<p>Jerry’s mouth tightened.</p>

<p>Jasmine continued. “But, no, that’s not what this line of code does. Not even close.”</p>

<p>I had been looking at the rest of the code on
the screen, and I noticed something.</p>

<p>“Jasmine, I think you’re wrong. Look at the line three lines above the
one you have highlighted.”</p>

<p>Jasmine smiled evilly, and moved the highlight
up.</p>

<p>“You mean this line, Alphonse?”</p>


<pre>List&lt;Impact&gt; impacts =
ImpactDB.getImpacts();</pre>



<p>“Yeah, it’s reading the impact list from the
database. That makes perfect sense
if the other line is scanning that list for small punctures.”</p>

<p>Jasmine’s smile got even broader. “Yes, that does make prefect
sense. But that’s not what’s going
on. Here, look at this.”</p>

<p>Jasmine scrolled up a few more lines.</p>



<pre>ImpactDB.setFilter(ImpactType.SMALL_PUNCTURE);</pre>


<p>Jerry and I looked at that line for a long
time. </p>

<p>“Confusing, isn’t it?” asked Jasmine.</p>

<p>“Yeah.” Said Jerry. “Why are they filtering on small punctures and then scanning
for small punctures. That seems
redundant.”</p>

<p>I just shook my head. </p>

<p>Jasmine nodded and scrolled down about 20
lines. “Now look at this. Keep in mind that the filter is still
set.”</p>


<pre>ImpactDB.saveImpacts(impacts);</pre>



<p>“Yikes! This is awful!” I blurted. Then I realized that Jean probably heard me. Jerry and Jasmine just snickered. </p>

<p>“Yeah, it’s pretty bad.” Said Jasmine
quietly. “So, any guess as to what
that original line of code does?”</p>

<p>Jerry pointed at the screen. “I guess it
depends on what that filter is doing.”</p>

<p>“Yeah.” Jasmine agreed. “It does.”</p>

<p>“I don’t get it.” I said. “Why would you read something, scan it,
and then write it. Nothing in this
code changes the <tt>impacts</tt> list.”</p>

<p>Jasmine looked at me out of the corner of her
green eyes. “Are you sure about that Hotshot? Look again at the line I called you over here for.”</p>

<p>My eyes scanned up the screen until I saw it.</p>



<pre> impactCount += scanImpacts(ImpactType.SMALL_PUNCTURE, impacts);</pre>



<p>It took about twenty seconds. Then:</p>

<p>“Oh! The <tt>impacts</tt> list is an <i>output</i>! Oh! The <tt>scanImpacts</tt> function gets all the impacts from some other source and <i>puts them into</i> the <tt>impacts</tt> list. Oh!”</p>

<p>Jerry rolled his eyes. “Of course. Duh; <tt>impacts</tt> is an
output. </p>

<p>“Yes, dears. The <tt>impacts</tt> list is an
output.”</p>

<p>Jean had managed to appear right next to us
while we were all staring at the screen. </p>

<p>She continued: “We didn’t know any better in
those days, my dears. We did the
best we could with what we knew, but we didn’t know that much. So we made really terrible errors like
this one…and so many others.”</p>

<p>“There was a time, my dears, when we weren’t
sure this ship would survive…oh but let’s not talk about that.”</p>

<p>The three of us were stunned. The ship’s survival was never in
question. Not ever. What was she talking about?</p>

<p>“Fortunately for us, dears, Mr. C. taught us
how to write much better code. You
should all go look at rule F2.”</p>

<p>With that, Jean sauntered back to her
workstation.</p>

<p>Jasmine smiled at us like the cat with feathers
on her mouth. She silently brought
up Mr. C’s rules.</p>


<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><strong>F2: Output Arguments</strong></p>

<p>Output
arguments are counterintuitive. Readers expect arguments to be inputs, not outputs. If your function must change the state
of something, have it change the state of the object it is called on.</p>
