<p><em>May
20, 1945, 22:23:00 GMT</em></p>
<p><em>The
war cabinet stared again and again at the aerial photographs that littered the
conference table.  &#8220;Well, that pretty much settles that; doesn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; Said General MacArthur.  </em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Yes
it does,&#8221; said Rear Admiral Souers, Chief of the newly formed Office of
Intelligence.  &#8220;Europe is dead, and Asia is dying.&#8221;  </em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t have believed it.&#8221; Said Hoover, &#8220;But a few of our
agents have reported in from Paris, and Berlin, and they confirm the assessment.
Losses in Europe appear to be 70%; and Asia may go higher than
that.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>President
Wallace shook his head in amazement.  &#8220;Terrible.&#8221; He said. 
&#8220;Just terrible.  And yet I can&#8217;t deny that there&#8217;s a certain
justice in all of this.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Patton
yanked the cigar out of his mouth and said: &#8220;It would have been justice if
we&#8217;d been the ones who&#8217;d done it.  But these nincompoops did it to
themselves.  That&#8217;s not justice, that&#8217;s just
incompetence.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;Do
we know for sure what happened?&#8221; asked Wallace.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Not
really.&#8221; Said Souers.  &#8220;All we know is that they started contracting
the Anthrax about a week before we did.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Patton
growled: &#8220;I wager the Nazis had huge stockpiles of the stuff to use
against us, and against the Japs and Bolsheviks too; once it suited their
purpose.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;We
may never know how it all got loose.&#8221; Said MacArthur.  &#8220;But one
thing&#8217;s certain.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
Said President Wallace.  &#8220;It&#8217;s just us against Clyde now.&#8221;
</em></p>

<hr />
<p><em>Tues, 13 Mar 2002,
09:00</em></p>
<p>I was working
quietly at my screen when I noticed Jean stand up and scan the room.  She saw me
and beamed. &#8220;Alphonse dear, would you please come here.  I&#8217;ve got
something I&#8217;d like you to see.&#8221;  </p>
<p>That meant I was
in trouble.  I stood up and sauntered over to her workstation.  Out of the
corner of my eye I saw Avery flash me a snickering grin.  He was enjoying this. 
</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down
right here, dear.&#8221; Jean said as I approached her desk.  She indicated to
the seat next to her.  So I sat down and she sat down along side. </p>
<p>&#8220;Now then,
dear, would you please look at this screen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh,
sure.&#8221;  I looked at her pad, and saw the following code:</p>

<pre>	protected void log(String message, int priority) {
      if (project != null) {
        project.log(message, priority);
      }
//      else {
//        System.out.println(msg);
//      }
    }
    </pre>
    <p>I&#8217;d
written this code yesterday.  So I knew I was in trouble for sure.  &#8220;I
wrote this yesterday Jean.  Jerry asked me to get rid of the messages that were
printing on the console after the project had been closed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,
dear, I can see that.  I can also see that instead of deleting the code, you
simply commented it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh,
right, I thought someone might change their mind and want those messages printed
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jean smiled
warmly at me and said: &#8220;I see.  But dear Alphonse, you do know that we Mr.
C. Doesn&#8217;t care for commented out code, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, oh. 
I&#8217;d forgotten that rule.  &#8220;Oh, yeah, I forgot about that. 
I&#8217;ll go delete it.&#8221;  But as a started to stand, Jean simply smiled
me back into my seat. </p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t
run off just yet, dear; we should talk about this for a minute.  Why did you
leave that code commented out like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>I remembered
Avery and Jean in the woodshed, and wondered if this was going to be like that.
&#8220;Well, like I said, I thought someone might change their mind and want
that message put back in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And did
you think that whoever would have to put it back in would not know how to call
<tt><strong>System.out.println</strong></tt>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh.&#8221;&#8220;Please
don&#8217;t stammer dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh... 
Sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So did
you, dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had to
backtrack the conversation to make sense of the question.  &#8220;N...no, I just
thought it would be more convenient for them if I left the code in there.  All
they&#8217;d have to do is uncomment it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,
dear, but if that&#8217;s why you left that commented code in there, then why
didn&#8217;t you put other convenient commented code in there?  After all, dear,
someone might want that message written to a text file.  You could have written
that code and commented it out so that it would be convenient for
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,
I...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what
if someone wanted the message converted into HTML and displayed in a drop down
box that blinked the message and then faded it out?  You could have put that
code in there too and then commented it out for convenience.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean,
I...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear,
I&#8217;m just pulling your leg a little.  But I hope you get my point.  Leaving
code commented out for convenience is really quite silly.  There&#8217;s just so
much code that would be convenient to have lying around that we&#8217;d soon
fill our programs with commented out code.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I
understand, Jean, I&#8217;ll be more careful next time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m
sure you will, Alphonse dear.  But before you go, can you tell me why the
<strong><tt>message</tt></strong>
variable has a different name in the commented out code?&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked back
and the screen.  Sure enough, the commented out section used
<strong><tt>msg</tt></strong>
instead of
<strong><tt>message</tt></strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yeah,
I, uh.. I refactored the code a bit after I made the change.  I thought
<strong><tt>message</tt></strong>
was a better name than

<strong><tt>msg</tt></strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I quite
agree with you dear, yes I do.  But when you made that change you didn&#8217;t
make it in the commented out code did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I
uh.. forgot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you
did.  And so how convenient would that be for someone who wanted to uncomment it
later?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I
guess they&#8217;d have a little trouble until they figured out that the name
had changed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it
wasn&#8217;t really very convenient at all, was it Alphonse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jasmine chose
that minute to stroll by.  As she turned to flash me a grin, her raven hair
rippled and danced around her face.  &#8220;Hey there hotshot, I hear you left
some code commented out.&#8221;  </p>

<p>&#8220;Jasimine
dear, you mind your own business now.&#8221; Jean scolded.</p>
<p>Jasmine
snickered but never broke her stride.  She disappeared around the
corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;My but
she&#8217;s a feisty young lady.&#8221; Jean said to the air.  &#8220;But
she&#8217;s a very good programmer.&#8221;</p>
<p>I waited, not
knowing what to do.  Jean stared contemplatively after Jasmine for a few seconds
more, and then turned back to me.   </p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all Alphonse dear, you can go back to
what you were working on now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you
Jean.&#8221; I said as I stood.  Then I walked back to my desk and sat back
down.  </p>
<p><strong>That was Hysterical!! ROTFL.</strong> Avery IMed me.</p>
<p>I turned around
and rolled my eyes at him.  Then I turned back and brought Mr. C&#8217;s rules
up on my pad.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title">C5: Commented-Out Code</p>
<p>It makes me crazy to see stretches of code that are commented out.  Who knows how
old it is?  Who knows whether or not it&#8217;s meaningful?  Yet no one will
delete it because everyone assumes someone else needs it or has plans for
it.</p>

<p>That code sits there and rots, getting less and less relevant with every passing day.
It calls functions that no longer exist.  It uses variables whose names have
changed.  It follows conventions that are long obsolete.  It pollutes the
modules that contain it and distracts the people who try to read it. 
Commented-out code is an <em>abomination</em>.</p>
<p>When you see commented-out code, <em>delete
it</em>!  Don&#8217;t worry; the
source code control system still remembers it.  If anyone really needs it, he or
she can go back and check out a previous version.  Don&#8217;t suffer
commented-out code to survive.</p>
